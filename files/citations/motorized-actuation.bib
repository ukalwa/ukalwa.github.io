abstract  ="We developed an open microfluidic system to dispense and manipulate discrete droplets on planar plastic sheets. Here{,} a superhydrophobic material is spray-coated on commercially-available plastic sheets followed by the printing of hydrophilic symbols using an inkjet printer. The patterned plastic sheets are taped to a two-axis tilting platform{,} powered by stepper motors{,} that provides mechanical agitation for droplet transport. We demonstrate the following droplet operations: transport of droplets of different sizes{,} parallel transport of multiple droplets{,} merging and mixing of multiple droplets{,} dispensing of smaller droplets from a large droplet or a fluid reservoir{,} and one-directional transport of droplets. As a proof-of-concept{,} a colorimetric assay is implemented to measure the glucose concentration in sheep serum. Compared to silicon-based digital microfluidic devices{,} we believe that the presented system is appealing for various biological experiments because of the ease of altering design layouts of hydrophilic symbols{,} relatively faster turnaround time in printing plastic sheets{,} larger area to accommodate more tests{,} and lower operational costs by using off-the-shelf products."}
