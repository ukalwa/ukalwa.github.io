As such, there is significant interest in developing portable, at-home melanoma diagnostic systems that can assess the risk of cancerous skin lesions. Here we present a smartphone application with capabilities of image capture, preprocessing, segmentation, extraction of ABCD features, and classification of the skin lesion malignancy based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Adaptive algorithms are incorporated at each stage of image processing which are computationally light, smartphone friendly, and reliable in discriminating melanoma cases from the benign ones. The smartphone application is trained using a subpart of a public dataset and tested on the other subpart along with mole images collected, in real-time, from two individuals.  The evaluated performance metrics and computation times are comparable or better than previous methods. This all-inclusive smartphone application is designed to be easy-to-download and easy-to-navigate for the end user, which is imperative for the eventual democratization of such medical diagnostic systems.","tags":[],"title":"Democratizing skin cancer diagnostics with an all-inclusive smartphone application","type":"publication"},{"authors":["\u003cb\u003eUpender Kalwa*\u003c/b\u003e","Chris Legner\\*","Taejoon Kong","Santosh Pandey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535000400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535000400,"objectID":"30d9598fd1d85555a5ae2b8941b956ba","permalink":"/publication/nematode-egg-counting/","publishdate":"2018-08-23T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nematode-egg-counting/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a growing need for exploring new sample cleaning and egg counting methods for plant-parasitic nematodes. Here, a better sample cleaning method is proposed, using an OptiPrep™ gradient density medium, while two semi-automatic egg counting methods which utilize custom software to automatically count the eggs are also discussed. The first counting method is a scanner imaging-based method and second is a lensless imaging-based method. A full, in depth, analysis of our sample cleaning method was conducted to calculate the egg recovery rates for different densities of the OptiPrep™ density gradient medium. A comparison of this egg recovery rate and that of the traditional sucrose-based method was also performed. The scanner counting method is simple and achieves accurate counts. While the lensless counting method uses flow cytometry and allows for the recovery of the eggs following the counting process. This method also works for unstained eggs which is essential for experiments where the viability of the eggs is important as the staining process often kills the organisms.","tags":[],"title":"A new and Efficient Soybean Cyst Nematode Egg Cleaning Method and a look at Applying Automated Counting Approaches to Sample Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jared Paul Jensen","\u003cb\u003eUpender Kalwa\u003c/b\u003e","Santosh Pandey","Gregory L Tylka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1529298000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529298000,"objectID":"ab2c7e4d2c95bc57a03ab0216ffb8e21","permalink":"/publication/scn-avicta/","publishdate":"2018-06-18T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/scn-avicta/","section":"publication","summary":"Nematicidal seed treatments are a relatively new strategy for managing plant-parasitic nematodes in row crops. Two such seed treatments, Avicta® (abamectin) and Clariva® (Pasteuria nishizawae), are marketed by Syngenta® for use against Heterodera glycines in soybean production in the upper Midwest. The specific effects of these seed treatments on the biology of the nematode have not been previously reported. The effects of Avicta and Clariva on H. glycines hatching, movement, attraction, penetration, development, and reproduction were determined in controlled-environment experiments. Avicta inhibited juvenile movement and penetration at the seed depth and 3 cm below the seed. Clariva inhibited juvenile movement and penetration 3 and 5 cm below the seed and nematode development within the roots of young plants. Both seed treatments affected nematodes in 10- and 20-day-old plants, but effects were not detected on nematodes developing in older plants (30 and 60 days) with larger root systems. These results provide details of the specific mechanisms of early season protection provided by Avicta and Clariva seed treatments.","tags":[],"title":"Avicta and Clariva affect the biology of the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jared Paul Jensen","Augustine Q Beeman","Zach L Njus","\u003cb\u003eUpender Kalwa\u003c/b\u003e","Santosh Pandey","Gregory L Tylka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525842000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525842000,"objectID":"7cc50b77a862ea4f5c0d2a6b2ccfa97e","permalink":"/publication/scn-movement/","publishdate":"2018-05-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/scn-movement/","section":"publication","summary":"Two new in vitro methods were developed to analyze plant-parasitic nematode behavior, at the population and the individual organism levels, through time-lapse image analysis. The first method employed a high-resolution flatbed scanner to monitor the movement of a population of nematodes over a 24-h period at 25°C. The second method tracked multiple motion parameters of individual nematodes on a microscopic scale, using a high-speed camera. Changes in movement and motion of second-stage juveniles (J2) of the soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines Ichinohe were measured after exposure to a serial dilution of abamectin (0.1 to 100 μg/ml). Movement and motion of H. glycines were significantly reduced as the concentration of abamectin increased. The effective range of abamectin to inhibit movement and motion of H. glycines J2 was between 1.0 and 10 μg/ml. Proof-of-concept experiments for both methods produced one of the first in vitro sensitivity studies of H. glycines to abamectin. The two methods developed allow for higher-throughput analysis of nematode movement and motion and provide objective and data-rich measurements that are difficult to achieve from conventional microscopic laboratory methods.","tags":[],"title":"Movement and Motion of Soybean Cyst Nematode Heterodera glycines Populations and Individuals in Response to Abamectin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zach Njus","Taejoon Kong","\u003cb\u003eUpender Kalwa\u003c/b\u003e","Christopher Legner","Matthew Weinstein","Shawn Flanigan","Jenifer Saldanha","Santosh Pandey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507525200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507525200,"objectID":"95806b7870bebfad12e6a588ad5e6f8d","permalink":"/publication/worms-on-paper/","publishdate":"2017-10-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/worms-on-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Today, the area of point-of-care diagnostics is synonymous with paper microfluidics where cheap, disposable, and on-the-spot detection toolkits are being developed for a variety of chemical tests. In this work, we present a novel application of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) to study the behavior of a small model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. We describe schemes of μPAD fabrication on paper and plastic substrates where membranes are created in agarose and Pluronic gel. Methods are demonstrated for loading, visualizing, and transferring single and multiple nematodes. Using an anthelmintic drug, levamisole, we show that chemical testing on C. elegans is easily performed because of the open device structure. A custom program is written to automatically recognize individual worms on the μPADs and extract locomotion parameters in real-time. The combination of μPADs and the nematode tracking program provides a relatively low-cost, simple-to-fabricate imaging and screening assay (compared to standard agarose plates or polymeric microfluidic devices) for non-microfluidic, nematode laboratories.","tags":[],"title":"A fast, reconfigurable flow switch for paper microfluidics based on selective wetting of folded paper actuator strips","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Taejoon Kong\\*","Shawn Flanigan\\*","Matthew Weinstein","\u003cb\u003eUpender Kalwa\u003c/b\u003e","Santosh Pandey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498885200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498885200,"objectID":"bccbf44f18458762e315ba82c3c2c16f","permalink":"/publication/paper-microfluidics/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/paper-microfluidics/","section":"publication","summary":"In paper microfluidics, the development of smart and versatile switches is critical for the regulation of fluid flow across multiple channels. Past approaches in creating switches are limited by long response times, large actuation fluid volumes, and use of external control circuitry. We seek to mitigate these difficulties through the development of a unique actuator device made entirely out of chromatography paper and incorporated with folds. Selective wetting of the fold with an actuation fluid, either at the crest or trough, serves to raise or lower the actuator's tip and thus engage or break the fluidic contact between channels. Here the actuator's response time is dramatically reduced (within two seconds from wetting) and a very small volume of actuation fluid is consumed (four microliters). Using this actuation principle, we implement six switch configurations which can be grouped as single-pole single-throw (normally OFF and normally ON) and single-pole double-throw (with single and double break). By employing six actuators in parallel, an autonomous colorimetric assay is built to detect the presence of three analytes − glucose, protein, and nitrite − in artificial saliva. Finally, this work brings the concept of origami to paper microfluidics where multiple-fold geometries can be exploited for programmable switching of fluidic connections.","tags":[],"title":"A fast, reconfigurable flow switch for paper microfluidics based on selective wetting of folded paper actuator strips","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Taejoon Kong\\*","Riley Brien\\*","Zach Njus","\u003cb\u003eUpender Kalwa\u003c/b\u003e","Santosh Pandey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467349200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467349200,"objectID":"ba59105529fce4bdecde4199de1fd3c9","permalink":"/publication/motorized-actuation/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/motorized-actuation/","section":"publication","summary":"We developed an open microfluidic system to dispense and manipulate discrete droplets on planar plastic sheets. Here, a superhydrophobic material is spray-coated on commercially-available plastic sheets followed by the printing of hydrophilic symbols using an inkjet printer. The patterned plastic sheets are taped to a two-axis tilting platform, powered by stepper motors, that provides mechanical agitation for droplet transport. We demonstrate the following droplet operations: transport of droplets of different sizes, parallel transport of multiple droplets, merging and mixing of multiple droplets, dispensing of smaller droplets from a large droplet or a fluid reservoir, and one-directional transport of droplets. As a proof-of-concept, a colorimetric assay is implemented to measure the glucose concentration in sheep serum. Compared to silicon-based digital microfluidic devices, we believe that the presented system is appealing for various biological experiments because of the ease of altering design layouts of hydrophilic symbols, relatively faster turnaround time in printing plastic sheets, larger area to accommodate more tests, and lower operational costs by using off-the-shelf products.","tags":[],"title":"Motorized actuation system to perform droplet operations on printed plastic sheets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zach Njus","Douglas Feldmann","Riley Brien","Taejoon Kong","\u003cb\u003eUpender Kalwa\u003c/b\u003e","Santosh Pandey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441602000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441602000,"objectID":"a25e174280e220dbc837e5d4e11553c8","permalink":"/publication/magnetic-field/","publishdate":"2015-09-07T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magnetic-field/","section":"publication","summary":"In nature, several organisms possess a magnetic compass to navigate or migrate them to desired locations. It is thought that these organisms may use biogenic magnetic matter or light-sensitive photoreceptors to sense and orient themselves in magnetic fields. To unravel the underlying principles of magnetosensitivity and magnetoreception, previous experiments have been conducted on bacteria, vertebrates, crustaceans, and insects. In this study, the model organism, C. elegans, is used to test their response and sensitivity to static magnetic fields in the range of 5 milli Tesla to 120 milli Tesla. Single wild-type C. elegans are put in microfluidic channels and exposed to permanent magnets for five cycles of thirty-second time intervals. The worm movement is recorded and analyzed with custom software to calculate the average velocity and the percentage of turning and curling. Contrary to some published studies, our results did not show a significant difference compared to control experiments. This suggests that C. elegans may not sense static magnetic fields in the range of field strengths that we tested.","tags":[],"title":"Characterizing the effect of static magnetic fields on C. elegans using microfluidics","type":"publication"}]
